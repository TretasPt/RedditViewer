She asked what I thought. . .\n\nI...don't know...\n\nShe was like...do you want it? I don't wanna make things weird between us. \n\nAnd me in full potato brain mode...I don't know.\n\nWe kept talking.  Psychology is a fun topic too. Don't outsmart your psychiatrist.

I don't remember what we were talking about when she uh...kissed me... anyway....looks like I forgot some parts.

Life is strange.  \n\nShe has a boyfriend. That's something that does bother me. Like...a sizable amount.  And again. She has some \"friends\". She said she broke off things with 2 of the 4 friends when drunk...and they told her that the next morning.  Fun. Imagine getting that call at 4am ahah.\n\nWow. I wasn't trying to make a long post. But I've been writing for almost an hour....not that bad.\n\nAfter that we kinda just kept talking. Nice environment, in the park. Sunny, but under the shade of a tree. A cork oak tree. Best tree. \n\nWeird. I was just thinking, she asked what I thought of it. And my answer wasn't like good or bad. Was again...I don't know how to feel.

Now...do something.&lt;/del&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Well uh...this was not an irrelevant event...aaaaa. Life is strange.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She has a boyfriend. That&amp;#39;s something that does bother me. Like...a sizable amount.  And again. She has some &amp;quot;friends&amp;quot;. She said she broke off things with 2 of the 4 friends when drunk...and they told her that the next morning.  Fun. Imagine getting that call at 4am ahah.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Wow. I wasn&amp;#39;t trying to make a long post. But I&amp;#39;ve been writing for almost an hour....not that bad.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After that we kinda just kept talking. Nice environment, in the park. Sunny, but under the shade of a tree. A cork oak tree. Best tree. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Weird. I was just thinking, she asked what I thought of it. And my answer wasn&amp;#39;t like good or bad. Was again...I don&amp;#39;t know how to feel. But I realized, that in all this, unlike what you could kinda expect, I wasn&amp;#39;t like horny.  Just happy. And very fucking nervous. Weird. I think. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Well, after talking for a bit more, we went home. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A awkward bye later...ah. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TLDR:Uh...first kiss. My abilities don&amp;#39;t surpass those of a lamp or a potato.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Bye people, I&amp;#39;ll do my best to sleep. I can&amp;#39;t garante anything.

Not that I know him...she is in a open relationship as she said it....&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She earlier had been telling herself that she wanted to finish things with all the side people. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was getting late. It was getting cold too. João had a t-shirt and shorts...2am...we went home. I lived close by and they would have to pass near my house anyway, so they dropped me off first. On the way she hugged me while we walked 3 times. My brain was on a full &amp;quot;idk what to do&amp;quot; mode. And we just kept walking. I didn&amp;#39;t have keys.....had to call my dad to open the door. He did. Said bye.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sooo....&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You think I did something wrong? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Something about those 10+ mentions to kissing me...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or those targeted hugs....&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Should I have said yes to the truth or dare?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m my own problem.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;You sounded so much like a nerd that I wanna kiss you and I&amp;#39;m not even into nerds.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hopefully we&amp;#39;ll meet again sometime soon. Maybe.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Oh. Wait. I remember talking about her. It&amp;#39;s the same person I thought had ghosted me. Yea...not long ago.

Idk. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;How is life supposed to work? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Wtf. Why is life supposed to work? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Idk. Let&amp;#39;s see. We eat. We shit. And we repeat the cycle forever. The first thing we do is eat and the last is shit. When you die you lose control over your butt. Sorry. Poopy dead person.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Imagine hanging yourself naked and someone finds you with a puddle of shit under your dangling body. Not fun. Probably won&amp;#39;t smell great. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Idk how the topic got to that. All I wanted to talk about was...idk traps? Not really.  Tombois maybe. Idk.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What is your kink, random time traveler who is reading my thoughts far from the 31st of may 2022?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Bye? Funny title? No?

I always stop myself from talking/writing when they are the subject.  In part because I'm afraid, but even if/when I have the balls to do it, I can't.  I just don't understand it. I can't talk about it because I don't understand it. And I know I'm going to make mistakes.  Bad ones. Ones that can have effect on people. \n\nFear is a funny thing. And the concept of \"life\" or \"sentient life\". Just a weird way of characterizing how oddly specific this specific group of self-replicating statistical improbabilities behaves.\n\nA cell is alive. A fungus is alive. A plant is alive. An organ is alive. But somehow viruses aren't. They don't meet the requirements.  We made the requirements. We chose what defines life and we want it to have a meaning.\n\nWhat are you? What are we? Are we just the group of cells that make us? Cells are being made and destroyed all the time at an absurd rate. Are we less of owerselves because of that? That's not what people chose to believe in. So, we are the ones that survive. But...what metrics are we using for survival? A cell can live away from the organism it belongs to, provided that it's needs are fulfilled. Is that cell not alive anymore? Is it not you anymore? What if it gets back to you? Is that you again? \n\nIt's hard to think about the subdivision of life being life. If your kidney gets removed and it's needs are fulfilled as before, now by a different organism, let's call that a person. You have been integrated in another organism.  Or...another organism has surrounded the subdivision of you I previously mentioned.  You are being kept there. In them. But the relationship is mutually beneficial, to the person organism that surrounds and to the kidney organism that is surrounded.  Both clusters of cells would die alone. So, you live on. And the person lives too.\n\nBut what if you receive a transplant? Don't you feel like the new organ is part of what you see as you?\n\nAs you see the boundaries of you are not well defined.  They never were. The identity of an organism is just a convention that works sometimes for one of the most successful mammals.  But that's it. An aggregation of those mammals could consist of an organism on itself. \n\nIf you chop off your finger and throw it out, is your finger you? Or is it it's own identity? But what if you reattach it instead? Did it ever stop being you just because it was away from the main cluster of cells?\n\nFor most of this questions I have tried not to force an opinion, but force a path to think.  Guide you into understanding what I think without telling exactly what it is.\n\nNow, a bigger question, can you be in a single cell? What if you are in every cell? What if your cell falls off? What if a cell from a different organism joins your cluster? If that cell keeps living and thrives. Who is it now? What if a new cell is born from merging two cells? If both are you, the new cell is certainly you, but what if...only one of them is you? Is the new cell both you and the person organism? Is it neither? Maybe a new organism? But this organism thrives and multiplies in the person organism. It is clearly part of them. But it also came from you. You made life. Made it keep going. Now that life has left the almost parasitic relationship it had with the person host organism. Is that still you? \n\nFiction authors fantasize about the collective consciousness, but isn't the finite infinity of you enough? You. We. Us. If both of us are the same cell that started life. We are all the same. We don't share some telepathic abilities like the movies would like, but we share our constitution, our history, our ancestors. We share part of our identity.  We are one. And many. Always together.  Even when alone. A single person organism consists of an absurdly large amount of exactly the things we are. We are life as we defined it.\n\nBut again. Life is just a mechanism. Just a pattern.  We chose to draw the line there, but the line is only as important as we need it to be. Move the line just a bit and viruses are life. But not only them. With that tiny move, planets became life. Galaxies.  Life is everything.  Life is the universe.  The never ending evolution. Repetition. Life is entropy.  Life is movement. No matter the size. \n\nSo..maybe life is not important, but life is everything.  It's worth trying to see this things this way. Without going too deep into the philosophy of it nor thinking of the weird implications (your computer is now alive and so is your dildo. Sweet dreams in your alive bed and pillow). \n\nThis was a good thought experiment.  Worth revisiting and polishing.  And it all started with a simple meaningless title. \n\nBye.","author_fullname":"t2_6yxmfbuj","saved":false,"mod_reason_title":null,"gilded":0,"clicked":false,"title":"634-Not important.","link_flair_richtext":[],"subreddit_name_prefixed":"u/NotMySecretAcount","hidden":false,"pwls":null,"link_flair_css_class":null,"downs":0,"thumbnail_height":null,"top_awarded_type":null,"hide_score":false,"name":"t3_uxun4h","quarantine":false,"link_flair_text_color":"dark","upvote_ratio":0.99,"author_flair_background_color":null,"subreddit_type":"user","ups":1,"total_awards_received":0,"media_embed":{},"thumbnail_width":null,"author_flair_template_id":null,"is_original_content":false,"user_reports":[],"secure_media":null,"is_reddit_media_domain":false,"is_meta":false,"category":null,"secure_media_embed":{},"link_flair_text":null,"can_mod_post":false,"score":1,"approved_by":null,"is_created_from_ads_ui":false,"author_premium":false,"thumbnail":"self","edited":false,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_richtext":[],"gildings":{},"content_categories":null,"is_self":true,"mod_note":null,"created":1653523082,"link_flair_type":"text","wls":null,"removed_by_category":null,"banned_by":null,"author_flair_type":"text","domain":"self.NotMySecretAcount","allow_live_comments":false,"selftext_html":"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nothing important to write today either.

About school.  He is a classmate. And his grades aren't great rn. Uni isn't exactly easy. Some of us are trying so hard, but the time you are expected to dedicate out of your free time is just incompatible with basic human needs.

He just told him, \"Ok, you'll have to get out in the next stop.\" Wich is already a generous thing to do since the procedure is to fine the people or call the cops.

I was ready to give up on everything else. Really.  Everyone else. I felt ready. I'm a little afraid of trying to join any branch of the military.  I'm afraid I'll like it. That my life will become that. That I will readily give up on every friendship I currently have in favor of that. Total focus. Simple life. Peacefulness in that stressful environment. Freedom to be noone. But I'm afraid to be simple.  I'm afraid my story can be written in a napkin and thrown away for its brevity and meaninglessness.  I'm afraid of being insignificant. Useless. Simple. \n\nWow...I did not expect that...I had the 3 paragraphs in mind but kinda made a little mess by getting slightly emotional.  The more you think less happier you can be. Fernando Pessoa and his poems made me actually believe that. The peacefulness and simplicity are comfortable, but we are drawn to thinking. I guess that's what makes us humans.\n\nAnyway, before getting here I was watching a good YouTube channel [Caroline Konstnar](https://youtube.com/c/CarolineKonstnar) . I was gonna binge watch it all, but thought it would be wise to sleep. I'll watch the remaining videos tomorrow.  But in the meantime I can assure you that the videos are great. I was gonna say \"her videos\", but even though she has a feminine voice and appearance, in most videos she is referenced as a \"he\", so I don't really know. Don't wanna assume anything/offend anyone. I like the humor and the visual look (of the videos). 80's vhs look. They are good. And also their hair. Idk. I like people's hair, don't judge me. (The hair seems to get shorter as you get closer to the present time.)\n\nToday wasn't just a meaningless quick post. This one took time. About its meaning?  Someone in the future might know.  Right now I'm the only one who knows this words exist and I am too tired to use any brain function. I'm doing this so I don't die. I need to keep backing up all of this posts.\n\nI avoided the lazy \"anyway\" transition, but I can't avoid the \"bye.\". The way it is written has a lot of meaning to me. I put a lot of my emotions into the details. \"Bye.\" isn't \"Bye!\" nor \"bye\". The last is very unfinished and uninterested, while the first and second show more interest.  The second shows emotion, excitement, happiness. I really do like you people and you usually make my day. The first one shows a finished though.  I didn't rush it by using a lowercase \"b\", but I decided not to show excitement either.  Where's my happiness?  I don't know where it is, but it certainly isn't there. If I'm unhappy with you this is the most likely for me to use. The simple \"Bye.\" Can feel so final. Sometimes it's just what I'm thinking about. Giving up  finally it's happening.  I'm done with whatever is happening around me. I say \"Bye.\" as the stupidest uninterpretable \"I need help.\" that I could find. And I give up.\n\nGiving up. I could talk a lot about that, but I've written 2 paragraphs already trying to finish this for today and am currently on the third. I guess I just have to leave, just like if I were giving up.  But I can't.  I can't. I just can't.  I don't want to eventually die. That's why I say to you bye. Bye.\n\nPS: Why does reddit break it's posting feature when it updates?

Starting with reality and extended by overthinking a specific detail or anything really.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But now, they barely ever reference the real world.  They just are inspired by it, but they don&amp;#39;t bother to include the source of the inspiration, the origin of the thought.  How helpful could it be anyway?

But tomorrow morning I'm gonna go cycling. Hope it's not too cold. I'd say 10°C is too cold for me. Predictions say 7 for the time I intend to leave home. We'll see. \n\nWas thinking about a post titled I'm still saving for now. \"If all else fails.\" As a wannabe programmer, I should probably just call it \"Else.\" But...idk. If all else fails sounds more important. \n\nI had a project I intended to call \"If all else fails.\" But ended up sticking with the name \"What If.\" Or rather \"WhatIf\" to better suit the way I intended to use it.\n\nPart of the WhatIf project is a 4 year old idea. First name I gave it was the long \"If all else fails.\". But the project evolved. It's much different now. And the name changed. The original project was simple. If all else fails, I want people to know something.  I wanted to leave a message targeted at everyone who I cared with. There are some things I regret from 10 years ago to now. Life is full of mistakes and some aren't forgotten, I guess. That was the original objective of the project. If all else fails, everyone will know. If I die and can't tell them, they'll still know. That was the objective.  But at some point I realized the similarities between this project and a simple, time tested, suicide letter.  Got me kinda spooked.  Actually closed that notebook for over 2 years after that. But for some reason I got it back. Fetched it from the attic.  I was still afraid someone could find out actually.  But that has no reason. I wrote that as vaguely as possible...in different ciphers I had recently learnt.  If someone ever stumbled upon that they would see them as test sentences.  `(Kinda reminds me of a textfile I had. I'll talk about that one someday.  Let's call it the \"RedFeelings(no communism)\")` anyway. Some time after that I started this project.  The NotMySecret project. And the \"If all else fails.\" idea changed drastically. \n\nAfter the start of this posts I realized that I didn't just have to choose a set of people and write something for them. I could set a system to help me dynamically change the \"archive\". Write multiple stuff about the people. Categorize them. Give them a profile. Maybe add pictures or audio files if I wanted. The project evolved from a simple message sender to a complex archive with many parts that needed to work together.  This new project that evolved from the previous one is called \"WhatIf\". The intention in the name is the same. What if I just died? Then what?(yea. I almost made an Avicii reference). That's the same idea. \"If all else fails.\" _this_ is what I want to happen. I don't want to be forgotten straight away. If I die. When I die. Everyone dies. Few are remembered after that. I don't know how nor why yet, but I want to be one of them. I want to be remembered for good reasons, while still showing everything.  Not hiding the bad things. I want to be remembered. \n\nThere was a man that gave me hope and made me think.  A very important man. A poet... Fernando Pessoa. He managed to avoid the second death so far. The first death is when you die. The second is when you are forgotten.  Through the big amount of things he did and wrote, and the amount of people he was, he managed to avoid being forgotten so far.  Some of his poems made me feel writing isn't as useless as I thought.  Maybe someone thinks the same thing you do. Maybe someone feels the same way you do. Even if noone does, someone will. Life is very weird. I still remember Little B crying over the end of a book we read in class (: got a bit sidetracked.  Anyway, sharing our thoughts is the way we can be remembered. Memory is made to store thoughts and feelings. If you wanna be remembered, why not trying to generate them? Thoughts, feelings, experiments or whatever you find mist suitable for you. \n\nFernando Pessoa. Him and his many identities made me believe I could leave a mark on the world. That's a reason to live. And if I die, I want everyone else to also know they left an influence on me. Enough for me to spend the time and think about them. To write about them. Maybe talk about them. Maybe make them feel happy, just a bit. \n\nAnyway, It's getting late and as I said I'll be cycling tomorrow.  See you then, if I don't die alone in the middle of nowhere after a crash or something.  Ahah...(haven't had a bike crash in years. Dw.)\n\nI love this longer posts. Make this project feel worth it.

And once you do half, you get a good idea if you&amp;#39;ll manage to do it or not. And I started believing.  And I did do a year. Now I&amp;#39;m aiming for the 500 days. Next? 1000. 500 days.

I've been writing for over 30 minutes but my phone decided music was more important and closed reddit while I changed the music.\n\nAnd it closed reddit again just now.  This time it didn't wipe out what I have written. \n\nLet's resume what I had wrote the first time. \n\nI still have a chance of joining airforce this year. Or at least I may have a chance to try.\n\nAnd the second part...it's just a shower though. \n\nI started thinking \"If modern medicine failed, who do you think would have the best and worst chances? Some of it may be their physical preparation, but it's surely also dependent on their mental capability.  If society collapsed not everyone would be OK.\"\n\nI think I would be one of the week ones. Not at first. But in 10 to 20 years. My chances of dying then are way bigger than anyone else's. Imagining I have about a 50/50 chance of being \"infected\" and that the disease only starts having effect between the ages of 30 and 50, and also that some people are asymptomatic carriers, let's say. Another 50/50 ~~so fake. It's closer to a 20/80 and already being very kind to round those numbers up. \"50/50\" is just absurd. If you are infected, just assume you are good be affected.~~\n\nSo...I may look healthy and be healthy at the moment, but nothing tells me I'll be it in 10 to 30 years. DNA. We don't fuck with DNA. DNA editing is too powerful.  It may easily be the end of us. CRISPR-CAS9.\n\n10 years. That's not a lot of time. This year I'll do the test for the \"infection\". It's a genetic disease.  Just wanted to make it sound simpler.\n\n\n\nWhile all this was happening I've been listening to Habits (Hippie Sabotage Remix)\n\nThinking about another music. Some Say. By Nea. A remix too.\n\nSwitched to this one now. In repeat. Over and over again.\n\nIs this ok? The lyrics. Why don't I know if it's good or not. The situation.  My brain tells me it's a very bad situation.  Waiting for someone you love to hopefully start loving you back. It's...stupid. You need to move on. But what it you...I can't? \n\nAren't there things you hate about yourself that you can't change? I'm remembering something someone once said. Keep remembering it when I'm about to consciously do something stupid. We were talking about...I was saying that I could hopefully change, be better with time. She said \"people never change. They just try but who they are will still be the same\".  Somehow she said it in a positive way. Saying I couldn't abandon anyone even if I wanted. \n\nThe part I never told her is that...maybe people don't change. They can just try for a long time. And keep trying.  Faking it for so long. What if who I am is just waiting for me to quit faking this. I'm kinda proving I can abandon people by not messaging her anymore. Or is it the other way around with her not replying and leaving me on read? Idk.\n\nDon't you ever wish that the past had been different? Why did I have to meet this person? The person I trust the most with a lot of misplaced trust. A person I like too much.  Sometimes I think it would be better if I had never known her. \n\nI'm kinda saying too much, but I have nothing to loose. Someday I'll be dead and none of this will matter.  Meaningless rambling. At least it's about an eternally relevant theme.  Human emotions. \n\nI sometimes think it would be beneficial to me if that person disappeared. If she just went away. Got a life elsewhere. The \"If\"s are worse than a no. Way worse.\n\n~~Sorry Daisy if you ever read this.~~\n\nNever intended to make one of my last posts all about anyone. Daisy. \n\nHey. Something I remembered.  M404 actually thought Daisy liked me at some point.  I'm not the only clueless dude who understands nothing. (:\n\nMr.T. You seem like you are getting better socially.  And also in school. I've known you for 5 years and it was a great evolution. I'm proud of you dude.\n\nM404. I meet you in the same day I meet Mr.T. you...didn't change that much. Your mood. Never gonna forget your way of being evil...while being one of the most morally correct people I know. First person I trusted in 4 years was you. Still the person I think I didn't misplace my trust in 5 years later. Hope someday I can see your social life improve just a tiny bit the way you said...\n\nHmm. Daisy. You deserve me to say something at least. The post is kinda about you, but still. Honesty..everyone likes that. Sometimes I wish I had never known you. But at the same time sometimes I wish I could just jump out of a plane, so...don't take it in an offensive way. I think I like you too much still and if you disappeared that could change. I think? Idk.\n\nLittle B. Haven't talked with you in ages. No substantial talk at least.  This is probably a goodbye post. I'm hopefully not going to die after this. But this has been a reason to be alive every day for almost a year now. You said GGU was worth it. You're the only one that made me feel happy about that. I was very bad in that time...I kinda cried multiple times a day...everyday for sometime.  The Tuesday plan...it was kinda close. I almost did it. I looked at the window everyday and thought about jumping.  Never with anywhere near enough courage to do it. Don't worry. But with all this I wanted to say \"Thank you.\" I would love to say to you \"Obrigado. \" in person while I hugged you, but I'm pretty sure I would shed a couple tears and my voice...wouldn't work as it should.  You know..crying affects my voice.  I've known you for less time than the others, but you are still awesome. Hope you get an awesome life.\n\nAgent 65B. The small person. Small people are cute. Don't take this the wrong way. Smoll person. I meet more smoll people. (Btw. The cuteness doesn't apply to our physics teacher.). I liked you. You were cool. Never talked much.  But you are cool. Loved helping you with math. Made me feel less useless. Made me think I should be a teacher. \n\nThe Salt. Awful nickname. We don't talk often enough for me to come up with another one. Hope you have a happy future. \n\nHmm. Bacon...you deserve to be here too. Never talked that much with you. But I still wish you the best of luck in life.\n\nGGU is done. Everyone is mentioned.  \n\nNow to everyone else.\n\nV. V. Oh V. Smoll V. ~~Fucking weeb!~~ I just love to say that. (:    Alien V.   You are awesome.  Just thinking about you is giving me a smile.  No negatives about you. You are too awesome. You were also very good when I was low. Talking with you all this time has been a pleasure. Gives me much happiness every time. Just being able to chill and message someone is awesome. Thanks for always being there. You actually sent me a message like 30 minutes ago, but I can't risk loosing 60 minutes of writing now. I'll go. Check it very soon.\n\nGerman dude. Still don't know how to call you Emperor.  The kind of the peaceful land. The boomern't. Being reference in some kids reddit post in his own profile. Feels almost like an offense to your majesty.  Ahah.\n\nMy friend with no face. I would not forget you in this. Your life doesn't seem easy and you are still alive. I'm happy your knifes couldn't cut butter in the summer. Happy for having you here.\n\nThe typical reddit user. With a name like the mascot of reddit. Now prefers being caled by a chemical formula.  I'm still not happy how to feel about you, but I value your good side.\n\nCB. Codename Bounjour. Not less important, at all. I'm just leaving you for last because it's different.  I knew I would never forget you. CB. I would love if you didn't live there and lived here, but that's not the reality. I loved talking with you all this time. You are someone I trust. I'm just waiting for your school to be over so that you have more free time to talk. Voicechatting with you was one of the best feelings since the beginning of the year.\n\nTo that one friend whose life I do not envy at all. Sexuality. Hot topic.  Hard to talk about.  I wish you a good luck in life. You deserve it. \n\nI feel like I need to same one person for tomorrow. I'm feeling tired and that person deserves all of me. Even if he never ends up knowing about this.\n\nThis post may be long. It feels like a goodbye. A suicide note. A last will something like that. \n\nI need to sleep. Doctor appointment tomorrow. \n\n\nSee you all someday beautiful people.","author_fullname":"t2_6yxmfbuj","saved":false,"mod_reason_title":null,"gilded":0,"clicked":false,"title":"362-Not just rambling.

Another 50/50 &lt;del&gt;so fake. It&amp;#39;s closer to a 20/80 and already being very kind to round those numbers up. &amp;quot;50/50&amp;quot; is just absurd. If you are infected, just assume you are good be affected.&lt;/del&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So...I may look healthy and be healthy at the moment, but nothing tells me I&amp;#39;ll be it in 10 to 30 years. DNA. We don&amp;#39;t fuck with DNA. DNA editing is too powerful.  It may easily be the end of us. CRISPR-CAS9.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;10 years. That&amp;#39;s not a lot of time. This year I&amp;#39;ll do the test for the &amp;quot;infection&amp;quot;. It&amp;#39;s a genetic disease.  Just wanted to make it sound simpler.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;While all this was happening I&amp;#39;ve been listening to Habits (Hippie Sabotage Remix)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thinking about another music. Some Say. By Nea. A remix too.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Switched to this one now. In repeat. Over and over again.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Is this ok? The lyrics. Why don&amp;#39;t I know if it&amp;#39;s good or not. The situation.  My brain tells me it&amp;#39;s a very bad situation.  Waiting for someone you love to hopefully start loving you back. It&amp;#39;s...stupid. You need to move on. But what it you...I can&amp;#39;t? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Aren&amp;#39;t there things you hate about yourself that you can&amp;#39;t change? I&amp;#39;m remembering something someone once said. Keep remembering it when I&amp;#39;m about to consciously do something stupid. We were talking about...I was saying that I could hopefully change, be better with time. She said &amp;quot;people never change. They just try but who they are will still be the same&amp;quot;.  Somehow she said it in a positive way. Saying I couldn&amp;#39;t abandon anyone even if I wanted. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The part I never told her is that...maybe people don&amp;#39;t change. They can just try for a long time. And keep trying.  Faking it for so long. What if who I am is just waiting for me to quit faking this. I&amp;#39;m kinda proving I can abandon people by not messaging her anymore. Or is it the other way around with her not replying and leaving me on read? Idk.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#39;t you ever wish that the past had been different? Why did I have to meet this person? The person I trust the most with a lot of misplaced trust. A person I like too much.  Sometimes I think it would be better if I had never known her. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m kinda saying too much, but I have nothing to loose. Someday I&amp;#39;ll be dead and none of this will matter.  Meaningless rambling. At least it&amp;#39;s about an eternally relevant theme.  Human emotions. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I sometimes think it would be beneficial to me if that person disappeared. If she just went away. Got a life elsewhere. The &amp;quot;If&amp;quot;s are worse than a no. Way worse.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;del&gt;Sorry Daisy if you ever read this.&lt;/del&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Never intended to make one of my last posts all about anyone. Daisy. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hey. Something I remembered.  M404 actually thought Daisy liked me at some point.  I&amp;#39;m not the only clueless dude who understands nothing. (:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Mr.T. You seem like you are getting better socially.  And also in school. I&amp;#39;ve known you for 5 years and it was a great evolution. I&amp;#39;m proud of you dude.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;M404. I meet you in the same day I meet Mr.T. you...didn&amp;#39;t change that much. Your mood. Never gonna forget your way of being evil...while being one of the most morally correct people I know. First person I trusted in 4 years was you. Still the person I think I didn&amp;#39;t misplace my trust in 5 years later. Hope someday I can see your social life improve just a tiny bit the way you said...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hmm. Daisy. You deserve me to say something at least. The post is kinda about you, but still. Honesty..everyone likes that. Sometimes I wish I had never known you. But at the same time sometimes I wish I could just jump out of a plane, so...don&amp;#39;t take it in an offensive way. I think I like you too much still and if you disappeared that could change. I think? Idk.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Little B. Haven&amp;#39;t talked with you in ages. No substantial talk at least.  This is probably a goodbye post. I&amp;#39;m hopefully not going to die after this. But this has been a reason to be alive every day for almost a year now. You said GGU was worth it. You&amp;#39;re the only one that made me feel happy about that. I was very bad in that time...I kinda cried multiple times a day...everyday for sometime.  The Tuesday plan...it was kinda close. I almost did it. I looked at the window everyday and thought about jumping.  Never with anywhere near enough courage to do it. Don&amp;#39;t worry. But with all this I wanted to say &amp;quot;Thank you.&amp;quot; I would love to say to you &amp;quot;Obrigado. &amp;quot; in person while I hugged you, but I&amp;#39;m pretty sure I would shed a couple tears and my voice...wouldn&amp;#39;t work as it should.  You know..crying affects my voice.  I&amp;#39;ve known you for less time than the others, but you are still awesome. Hope you get an awesome life.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Agent 65B. The small person. Small people are cute. Don&amp;#39;t take this the wrong way. Smoll person. I meet more smoll people. (Btw. The cuteness doesn&amp;#39;t apply to our physics teacher.). I liked you. You were cool. Never talked much.  But you are cool. Loved helping you with math. Made me feel less useless. Made me think I should be a teacher. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Salt. Awful nickname. We don&amp;#39;t talk often enough for me to come up with another one. Hope you have a happy future. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hmm. Bacon...you deserve to be here too. Never talked that much with you. But I still wish you the best of luck in life.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;GGU is done. Everyone is mentioned.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now to everyone else.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;V. V. Oh V. Smoll V. &lt;del&gt;Fucking weeb!&lt;/del&gt; I just love to say that. (:    Alien V.   You are awesome.  Just thinking about you is giving me a smile.  No negatives about you. You are too awesome. You were also very good when I was low. Talking with you all this time has been a pleasure. Gives me much happiness every time. Just being able to chill and message someone is awesome. Thanks for always being there. You actually sent me a message like 30 minutes ago, but I can&amp;#39;t risk loosing 60 minutes of writing now. I&amp;#39;ll go. Check it very soon.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;German dude. Still don&amp;#39;t know how to call you Emperor.  The kind of the peaceful land. The boomern&amp;#39;t. Being reference in some kids reddit post in his own profile. Feels almost like an offense to your majesty.  Ahah.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My friend with no face. I would not forget you in this. Your life doesn&amp;#39;t seem easy and you are still alive. I&amp;#39;m happy your knifes couldn&amp;#39;t cut butter in the summer. Happy for having you here.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The typical reddit user. With a name like the mascot of reddit. Now prefers being caled by a chemical formula.  I&amp;#39;m still not happy how to feel about you, but I value your good side.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;CB. Codename Bounjour. Not less important, at all. I&amp;#39;m just leaving you for last because it&amp;#39;s different.  I knew I would never forget you. CB. I would love if you didn&amp;#39;t live there and lived here, but that&amp;#39;s not the reality. I loved talking with you all this time. You are someone I trust. I&amp;#39;m just waiting for your school to be over so that you have more free time to talk. Voicechatting with you was one of the best feelings since the beginning of the year.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To that one friend whose life I do not envy at all. Sexuality. Hot topic.  Hard to talk about.  I wish you a good luck in life. You deserve it. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I feel like I need to same one person for tomorrow. I&amp;#39;m feeling tired and that person deserves all of me. Even if he never ends up knowing about this.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This post may be long. It feels like a goodbye. A suicide note. A last will something like that. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I need to sleep. Doctor appointment tomorrow. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;See you all someday beautiful people.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","likes":null,"suggested_sort":"qa","banned_at_utc":null,"view_count":null,"archived":true,"no_follow":false,"is_crosspostable":true,"pinned":false,"over_18":false,"all_awardings":[],"awarders":[],"media_only":false,"can_gild":true,"spoiler":false,"locked":false,"author_flair_text":null,"treatment_tags":[],"visited":false,"removed_by":null,"num_reports":null,"distinguished":null,"subreddit_id":"t5_2s3016","author_is_blocked":false,"mod_reason_by":null,"removal_reason":null,"link_flair_background_color":"","id":"pcygsh","is_robot_indexable":true,"report_reasons":null,"author":"NotMySecretAcount","discussion_type":null,"num_comments":1,"send_replies":true,"whitelist_status":null,"contest_mode":false,"mod_reports":[],"author_patreon_flair":false,"author_flair_text_color":null,"permalink":"/r/u_NotMySecretAcount/comments/pcygsh/362not_just_rambling_also_saying_an_early_goodbye/","parent_whitelist_status":null,"stickied":false,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/u_NotMySecretAcount/comments/pcygsh/362not_just_rambling_also_saying_an_early_goodbye/","subreddit_subscribers":0,"created_utc":1630106179,"num_crossposts":0,"media":null,"is_video":false}},{"kind":"t3","data":{"approved_at_utc":null,"subreddit":"u_NotMySecretAcount","selftext":"Playing  splitgate again.\n\nWait times for the medic are around 40 days...I have a 14 days deadline...","author_fullname":"t2_6yxmfbuj","saved":false,"mod_reason_title":null,"gilded":0,"clicked":false,"title":"361-No time.","link_flair_richtext":[],"subreddit_name_prefixed":"u/NotMySecretAcount","hidden":false,"pwls":null,"link_flair_css_class":null,"downs":0,"thumbnail_height":null,"top_awarded_type":null,"hide_score":false,"name":"t3_pcalyg","quarantine":false,"link_flair_text_color":"dark","upvote_ratio":1,"author_flair_background_color":null,"subreddit_type":"user","ups":2,"total_awards_received":0,"media_embed":{},"thumbnail_width":null,"author_flair_template_id":null,"is_original_content":false,"user_reports":[],"secure_media":null,"is_reddit_media_domain":false,"is_meta":false,"category":null,"secure_media_embed":{},"link_flair_text":null,"can_mod_post":false,"score":2,"approved_by":null,"is_created_from_ads_ui":false,"author_premium":false,"thumbnail":"self","edited":false,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_richtext":[],"gildings":{},"content_categories":null,"is_self":true,"mod_note":null,"created":1630018406,"link_flair_type":"text","wls":null,"removed_by_category":null,"banned_by":null,"author_flair_type":"text","domain":"self.NotMySecretAcount","allow_live_comments":false,"selftext_html":"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Playing  splitgate again.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Wait times for the medic are around 40 days...I have a 14 days deadline...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","likes":null,"suggested_sort":"qa","banned_at_utc":null,"view_count":null,"archived":true,"no_follow":false,"is_crosspostable":true,"pinned":false,"over_18":false,"all_awardings":[],"awarders":[],"media_only":false,"can_gild":true,"spoiler":false,"locked":false,"author_flair_text":null,"treatment_tags":[],"visited":false,"removed_by":null,"num_reports":null,"distinguished":null,"subreddit_id":"t5_2s3016","author_is_blocked":false,"mod_reason_by":null,"removal_reason":null,"link_flair_background_color":"","id":"pcalyg","is_robot_indexable":true,"report_reasons":null,"author":"NotMySecretAcount","discussion_type":null,"num_comments":0,"send_replies":true,"whitelist_status":null,"contest_mode":false,"mod_reports":[],"author_patreon_flair":false,"author_flair_text_color":null,"permalink":"/r/u_NotMySecretAcount/comments/pcalyg/361no_time/","parent_whitelist_status":null,"stickied":false,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/u_NotMySecretAcount/comments/pcalyg/361no_time/","subreddit_subscribers":0,"created_utc":1630018406,"num_crossposts":0,"media":null,"is_video":false}},{"kind":"t3","data":{"approved_at_utc":null,"subreddit":"u_NotMySecretAcount","selftext":"360°...It's...a full turn...ok.

The next one after that. The exam grades are out. I don't know what to think.  I need to accelerate the physical training.  Aaa. \n\nI'm gonna try air force.

Abandon it and make the world forget it ever existed. It's safer that way \n\nBut I'm not gonna get admitted.  I possibly have a genetic disease and they are picky with that kind of stuff(which is a good thing. We don't want everyone flying a weapon.).\n\n\n\nMy cat is sleeping on a folded blanket on the floor. He had couches and beds. But he seems comfortable where he is.\n\n\nDo you ever think of doing armless illegal stuff? For some reason my brain tells me to trespass into abandon private properties. Who's gonna get hurt other than me? Seems like a risk I could live with.\n\n~~I may or may not want to climb on top of some old, some abandoned and others not, water towers. There is one near my school that is abandoned.  By the looks of it it may be idk. 50 or 60 years old. The new ones are probably older than me. (When a thing is built to last, age is not a problem). Anyway. I wanna climb on top of a water tower near school. I told this to some...friends...this word is broken for me now ahah (,:   anyway. I told them I wanted to climb it and they brushed it of as a joke...I'm afraid I may do it someday.~~\n\n\nJust realized.  I made it till the end of the secondary(how the last 3 years of mandatory school are called) without doing the tuesday plan!    \nIt may sound like a silly observation, but at the worst time I conceived a plan to just skip school, walk home get my bike back home and just go north. Just go. Probably would stop somewhere to eat a sandwich.  And then, near the sunset, I would call my dad.     \nIt still feels like a weird plan. Not that logical. But I was stressed and tired of everything, so...I kinda wanted to disappear for a bit. Anyway. I still can't fully talk about this, but it's definitely good I didn't do it. It would have had consequences. \n\n\n\n00:35. See? Lifting the time restriction helped.\n\nI need to finish the GGU wood project soon. GGU doesn't have a meaning or relevance anymore. It's just part of the past. \n\nNow after this amount of diverse topics I don't know how to name this post.  It needs to be something meaningful.  It needs to mean something to me.\n\nI still didn't really get in to the friends conversation.  \n\nHow much time would it take for me to listen to all this posts on text to speech?

Taking away the time restriction may help.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Monday. Not tomorrow, not the day after. The next one after that. The exam grades are out. I don&amp;#39;t know what to think.  I need to accelerate the physical training.  Aaa. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m gonna try air force. And if that fails I&amp;#39;m gonna try to get a programing degree or something.  I don&amp;#39;t know this specific names in english &lt;del&gt;nor do I know them in portuguese. Honestly.  That &amp;quot;nor&amp;quot; feels out of place there  &amp;quot;neither? Idk&lt;/del&gt;    &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If I do get into the airforce(even if only for recruit) I will completely abandon this account.  Abandon it and make the world forget it ever existed. It&amp;#39;s safer that way &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I&amp;#39;m not gonna get admitted.  I possibly have a genetic disease and they are picky with that kind of stuff(which is a good thing. We don&amp;#39;t want everyone flying a weapon.).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My cat is sleeping on a folded blanket on the floor. He had couches and beds. But he seems comfortable where he is.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Do you ever think of doing armless illegal stuff? For some reason my brain tells me to trespass into abandon private properties. Who&amp;#39;s gonna get hurt other than me? Seems like a risk I could live with.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;del&gt;I may or may not want to climb on top of some old, some abandoned and others not, water towers. There is one near my school that is abandoned.  By the looks of it it may be idk. 50 or 60 years old. The new ones are probably older than me. (When a thing is built to last, age is not a problem). Anyway. I wanna climb on top of a water tower near school. I told this to some...friends...this word is broken for me now ahah (,:   anyway. I told them I wanted to climb it and they brushed it of as a joke...I&amp;#39;m afraid I may do it someday.&lt;/del&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just realized.  I made it till the end of the secondary(how the last 3 years of mandatory school are called) without doing the tuesday plan!&lt;br/&gt;\nIt may sound like a silly observation, but at the worst time I conceived a plan to just skip school, walk home get my bike back home and just go north. Just go. Probably would stop somewhere to eat a sandwich.  And then, near the sunset, I would call my dad.&lt;br/&gt;\nIt still feels like a weird plan. Not that logical. But I was stressed and tired of everything, so...I kinda wanted to disappear for a bit. Anyway. I still can&amp;#39;t fully talk about this, but it&amp;#39;s definitely good I didn&amp;#39;t do it. It would have had consequences. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;00:35. See? Lifting the time restriction helped.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I need to finish the GGU wood project soon. GGU doesn&amp;#39;t have a meaning or relevance anymore. It&amp;#39;s just part of the past. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now after this amount of diverse topics I don&amp;#39;t know how to name this post.  It needs to be something meaningful.  It needs to mean something to me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I still didn&amp;#39;t really get in to the friends conversation.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;How much time would it take for me to listen to all this posts on text to speech? Could I do it with 13.ai?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyway. 00:40.

I don't know. I don't imagine myself in the future very often, but Daisy made me see it. Like a very vivid dream. Except it hasn't happened yet. \n\nWe where talking and the age topic came up. We are 18. We will be 18 this year. Wow. I said something about her learning to drive. She said something like \"I'm not sure if I want to be another danger on the road.\"    \n—Why?\n—I DON'T WANT TO RUN OVER SOMEONE OK? – she sayis in a funny but real way. —Are you going to run me over?(or am I gonna be the first victim or something simillar. To be honnest my mind had already driffeted off to statistics. I'll explain in a bit.).     \nShe said —No...–semi-long pause– you're gonna be on the shotgun seat.\n\nThis. This simple conversation made me unlock a new world of overthinking potential ideas.\n\nAt the time of writing I am in the beginning of the 3rd and last part of the school year. Well...I'll be in a week. And I don't know what am I going to do with my life. I need to make a choice soon. Very soon. I don't know what todo. Everyone seems to have their shit together or to at least have an idea for the future and I'm here. Letting life pass again. But anyways. I am just getting off topic. I can't imagine my future, after the end of this year, very often. But when I do I'm always alone. This last time it was weird. Fuck. I hope I can read this message in the last day of this project and be happy. Have a future. Having friends.\n\nI don't see any way of keeping contact with people. Everyone will get a life of their own. And I don't know what I am doing.\n\nLast summer I noticed this was gonna be my ladt shot. I either connect with people now, make friends, find a way to be happy, or I never will.\n\n\n\n\n\nOk. I got lost, so I'll assume I said it all.\n\n\nOne day later I got to think about how easy it would be for me to just disapear and people wouldn't care. But my rational side told me they are all human. They are good people. Their anime talk fucking killed me. But I couldn't say a thing. I was too busy overthinking and making myself feel bad.\n\nWho cares about me? That is a weird question. My parents do. Family does. What about friends? What friends? Is it weird to feel like you have been thrown into the friend zone and don't feel like the people even see you as a friend? How much of what I'm saying is garbage? Just a rambling persons message. 200 days have passed. What am I gonna do after this? I started this in like august or september. Idk.after I finish this I won't have any goal in life. No big project I can't miss. This hasn't been hard. But some days it wasn't easy either. Sometimes I just want to sleep or llay or something.  But I have to do this. This is one of the most important things in my life at the moment.\n\n\n\nOk. I talked about two days ago. I talked about yesterday.  And what about today? Today? Today was a day too. Today I was already overthinking in the morning.  First thing when I wake up. What am I gonna do? Quit everything?  Be honest to people? Pretend it never happened? Isolate myself again? Do something stupid?  I'm not sure.after publishing this I'm going to send a message to an old WhatsApp group. Will it work? No. Will it be funny? Probably not. Will someone answear? Well. I can try and find out.\n\n\n\nAaaa. I'm overthinking the past and the future. I have been so hiped with coming back to school. Online classes suck. But presential school has bad sides too.    \nI used to like it because I could be with my friends, but now I feel lonelier when I'm with them. I feel like for them I am just an old acquaintance that hasn't understood his place. I'll go to school and do what? Pop up say hi to them. 2 people answear back. Agent 65B watches from far away. Daisy says Hi and keeps talking with someone else. Mr.T joins Daisy and his classmates. And I...I isolate myself from my classmates and get isolated from my old classmates.\n\nI like games. The name \"Life is Steange\" comes up in my mind very often when I'm overthinking. \"When the Darkness comes\" is one that I hope never comes up in my thoughts. Whenever the day is that the Darkness decides to come, I don't know if I'm ready. \n\nAaa. I'm not ready for this world. I'm here writing about meaningless stuff that no one else cares about. Why?\n\n20 minutes left. \n\nWhat am I going todo with my life? I don't want to feel alone forever. I can't make friends in my class. It would already be hard, but with corona it is even harder.\n\nOk. Honestly, Codename Bonjour has been the only one that makes me want to be online lately.

In the end I had to go back like 5km because the street was underwater in both sides of the bifurcation. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ok. I&amp;#39;ll keep writing tomorrow in a bit.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","likes":null,"suggested_sort":"qa","banned_at_utc":null,"view_count":null,"archived":true,"no_follow":false,"is_crosspostable":true,"pinned":false,"over_18":false,"all_awardings":[],"awarders":[],"media_only":false,"can_gild":true,"spoiler":false,"locked":false,"author_flair_text":null,"treatment_tags":[],"visited":false,"removed_by":null,"num_reports":null,"distinguished":null,"subreddit_id":"t5_2s3016","author_is_blocked":false,"mod_reason_by":null,"removal_reason":null,"link_flair_background_color":"","id":"lrqyec","is_robot_indexable":true,"report_reasons":null,"author":"NotMySecretAcount","discussion_type":null,"num_comments":0,"send_replies":true,"whitelist_status":null,"contest_mode":false,"mod_reports":[],"author_patreon_flair":false,"author_flair_text_color":null,"permalink":"/r/u_NotMySecretAcount/comments/lrqyec/178back_to_writing_two_part_posts/","parent_whitelist_status":null,"stickied":false,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/u_NotMySecretAcount/comments/lrqyec/178back_to_writing_two_part_posts/","subreddit_subscribers":0,"created_utc":1614211172,"num_crossposts":0,"media":null,"is_video":false}},{"kind":"t3","data":{"approved_at_utc":null,"subreddit":"u_NotMySecretAcount","selftext":"2min left.

But there are only 14 minutes till tomorrow and I want to sleep and pretend to be creative. \n\nDuring the day I kinda already had an idea if what I was gonna talk about. When I was writing the 124 almost 24 hours ago, I had already started thinking about it.\n\nI want to talk a bit about the future. And why my ultimate choice is probably just not right for me. I...ok. I'll explain it in a bit.\n\nToday it was just another weekend. I spent the day with my dad. Slept until like 10 am, which is kinda late for what I like, saw some videos, went out with my dad to eat and came back home.\n\nThen I spent a fairly big chunk of time in the garage, mainly with the belt sander, just trying to make a circle that actually resembled a circle. There are still many hours to go, but I am happy with the way it is going so far.(shit. I just started thinking that wood varnish and repeated long duration eat aren't that good of a match...)\n\nOk. That was kinda my day. My dad did his own project, and at around 5pm we both dropped the work and called it a day. Both came up and ate some cake. He went to watch tv and I went to youtube. Dinner and all. Nothing that important. Time passed and I'm here right now.\n\nI was watching some videos and a recommended video just catched my attention.\n\nAnd I can now see that after this long introduction I only have 3 minutes left.

When I was writing the 124 almost 24 hours ago, I had already started thinking about it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I want to talk a bit about the future. And why my ultimate choice is probably just not right for me. I...ok. I&amp;#39;ll explain it in a bit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Today it was just another weekend. I spent the day with my dad. Slept until like 10 am, which is kinda late for what I like, saw some videos, went out with my dad to eat and came back home.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then I spent a fairly big chunk of time in the garage, mainly with the belt sander, just trying to make a circle that actually resembled a circle. There are still many hours to go, but I am happy with the way it is going so far.(shit. I just started thinking that wood varnish and repeated long duration eat aren&amp;#39;t that good of a match...)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ok. That was kinda my day. My dad did his own project, and at around 5pm we both dropped the work and called it a day. Both came up and ate some cake. He went to watch tv and I went to youtube. Dinner and all. Nothing that important. Time passed and I&amp;#39;m here right now.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was watching some videos and a recommended video just catched my attention.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And I can now see that after this long introduction I only have 3 minutes left.

This is more of 123. I still know how to count (:\n\nOk. I am not really sure what I wanna talk about. I just...need to. Not that I'm sad or anything. Today it is not that. I just have somethings that haven't left my head in a long time and I haven't been having time to say anything.\n\nFirst of all, let's start with a weird one that I have been wondering if I should or should not write for some days.     \nIn the end I thought I was gonna post it to another account, but I don't want to. This is me. And it isn't anything that bad.\n\n[I cannot forget that my cat tried to _take my eye out_ \n{Just kidding. I pissed him off. He just wanted me to leave him alone. He is a sweat cat.}]\n\nOk. Ok. Aa. Ok. I'm gonna write this. Ok. You know those times when you are trying to get motivation to do something? I'm gonna do this. Ok. Let's go.\n\nOk. Some days ago I just had a thought. I don't remember every detail. Multiple days have passed and I kinda tried to ignore that I ever thought about that, so give me a break. My mind will be a bit fuzzy.\n\nFor some reason, in that thought, something made me want to take my own life. And fast. I remember thinking that that was a very unlikely situation, but still possible. I just (in that thoght) wanted to die as fast as possible. And so I took a small knife, less that 2cm long from my pocket(where it actually is in real life) and I cut my left wrist.\n\nNoting that weird. It is just the fact that it looked so plausible that made me think about it a lot.\n\nRight after \"cutting my wrist\" I woke up from that thought, but it seems like my rational and irrational side where working together. I woke up from that \"dream\" in the middle of the day and my rational side could only think \"what a stupid decision. I should have made more cuts. I wanna die fast. \" and as my rational side kept going it kinda shifted tactics \"Why would I cut my wrists? That is stupid and slow. Stab it in the right side of your neck with your left hand.\"\n\nMy brain didn't talk. I could see those things as if I was dreaming. Those are just representations of what I felt.\n\nAgain I am not suicidal. I never thought about self harm. This random thing just made me think about a lot of other random things. \n\nI am afraid of death. I have said that before. Both mine and others. I am afraid of suddenly having some weird moment and out of a sudden loosing my interest in life and...you know...take my life away.\n\n[Oh shit. I just thought about something. It is related to the military. And death. Murder. I don't think I have time rn]\n\nOk.what more did I wanted to talk about? I had a lot of things, but now that I have already said the weird one, I don't remember them so easily.\n\nOk. This other one scares me a bit more. During online classes...I was at my dads house. In the attic. Alone. In some classes, I looked at the window. Stared at it.\n\nSometimes looking at the beautiful world behind. Others just looking at the window itself, but always thinking.\n\nI am afraid of the amount of times I thought about jumping. Again. I wasn't hating my life or anything. I just...it felt a lot like a \"why not\" moment. In my brain I would always win that internal question. Never came even close to seriously considering doing something. \n\nBut just the fact that I spent so much time thinking about it scares me. I usually thought that I should see that as a dive and not as a jump. I wouldn't want to climb up that window, I just want to jump. Be free for a small spam of time that I have refused to calculate and then just stop being. I know. That height could easily let me survive. I just...idealized death for some brief spams of time every time I was in class and it was too hard, or too boring, or I felt dumb and stupid.\n\n[I just saved my progress, even if reddit crashes, I hope I don't lose progress this time (: ]\n\nWhy is it that death i the scariest thing, but can sometimes feel like the idyllic thing to do. The best way of living is not doing it at all.\n\nIn both things, what scared me the most was that they were both possible. Both could be real. In both my motivations where stupid. Pointless. I felt like life was a bit pointless too, when I thought them.\n\nI have been trying to stop writing this post for a while. I always feel like I'm leaving out something important, or getting someone worried, or not telling the full truth. But...I have time. I will say the truth. I don't want people to be even slightly worried. Everyone should be happy. \n\nOk. I need to stop writing. \n\nConclusion?\n\nDeath is scary. The way I imagine myself taking my life in believable ways scares me. Those where just the two main stories. Some others are less coherent. Some are simpler and just involve me riding my bike as far away as I can in a tuesday. (I like that one actually. I believe that that could have an happy ending.)\n\nAnd the conclusion is?\n\nOk. Death is scary, and even though I thought about it a lot I would never hurt myself(on purpose, that is. My stupidity can still hurt me (:  ) If I ever where to seriously think  about it, I would ask for help. Don't worry.\n\nIs that it?\n\nYea. I think so. \n\nAny more unnecessary interactions between you and yourself?\n\nNop. You are the last one. Thanks for pointing it out.\n\nOk guys. I might need to sleep. I need to end this. I have already spent 51 straight minutes typing this.\n\nOk. Last things. I am horrible at goodbyes, even if it is just for a few hours until next post. It is mid night and 52 minutes.\n\nI love my cat, who is laying on my chest rn.\n\n40 minutes ago someone talked on nani. I hope the understand that I was doing something way more stupid, so I couldn't be there.\n\nOk. Ok. I know. I need to sleep. Why are goodbyes so hard. It is not like this was the last one. (It would be very ironic if I where ran over by a truck later today).\n\nOk. I love you all, I don't think many people will read this. I am not sure anyone is going to read this. This ended up being a bit long. I'm not sure I'm gonna read this either. \n\nOk. I love you all. Don't worry about me. And see you tomorrow.\n\nI just wanted to say that knowing that some of you care about me makes me pretty happy.\n\nOh. And if I haven't said it, I am happy today. The post has nothing to do with what I'm feeling. I just finally had both the time and the balls to do it.\n\nTLDR:    \nI love you all and you being there helps me a lot more than you know.\n(I knot that this is not how a tldr is supposed to work.)\n\nI'm gonna wait just one more minute and I'll be typing for a full hour.\n\nOk. 1 am.

I will not forget any of them. \n\nFrom bad moments, good things are born. It can be truth.  I was a bit lonely. A bit sad. And a bit bored. \n\nI some of us started talking in a whatsapp group. We where 4. JC, S, Mr.T and me. That group was good. It introduced me to someone I ended up liking a lot.\n\nI just needed someone to talk and S was there. ~~At least until I fucked that up.~~\n\nBut ok. Me, S and C, a friend of S, formed a new group.(whatsapp). We talked for quite a while. The three of us reached insane high numbers of daily messages. Something like I had never seen. I felt like I had friends.\n\nI remember staying on call with S for hours. She was nice. At that moment our conversation could only be described as mental diarrhea, but I liked it. I think she liked it to.\n\nOk. I just found out that I am doing a 2020 recap in the first day of december. It was on accident, but it is a nice coincidence. \n\nBut this is enough for now.

It was in february. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Most things have been getting worse since then.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But many good things have happened also. I will not forget any of them. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;From bad moments, good things are born. It can be truth.  I was a bit lonely. A bit sad. And a bit bored. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I some of us started talking in a whatsapp group. We where 4. JC, S, Mr.T and me. That group was good. It introduced me to someone I ended up liking a lot.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I just needed someone to talk and S was there. &lt;del&gt;At least until I fucked that up.&lt;/del&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But ok. Me, S and C, a friend of S, formed a new group.(whatsapp). We talked for quite a while. The three of us reached insane high numbers of daily messages. Something like I had never seen. I felt like I had friends.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I remember staying on call with S for hours. She was nice. At that moment our conversation could only be described as mental diarrhea, but I liked it. I think she liked it to.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ok. I just found out that I am doing a 2020 recap in the first day of december. It was on accident, but it is a nice coincidence. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But this is enough for now. I need to sleep. Just this post has took me 25 minutes to type.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Again.

It has been 30 minutes. I have to start.\n\nOk. First of all. If anyone from GGU ever stumbles upon this, first, be welcome. Second, at the time of writing I have already left GGU a couple hours ago(5 or so hours) and I have only talked to Bacon. [I need to get him a new name. I was never a fan of this one.]. I didn't stop liking any of you people. I have said it before and will say it again. I am a bit tired of the idea of GGU. Not even the name is being followed(it means Big United Group).

Hope in this case.  As you where someone sort of reliable in which I trust, and also not too involved with this group I had to talk to you. When my mind got set into that idea there was no turning back.\n\nSo I sent you a message. \"Hey\". Much thought went into this message. Probably with no reason. When I miss a period is on purpose.

I had been thinking about it for way longer than I care to admit.    \nAnd maybe someone would just add me back. Idk. I have done that to people in the past. I liked her. She just got angry sometimes and left(this is another group btw).\n\nAfter that I studied way more than I had been studying before. My brain was free from that decision. There was nothing else I could do. My hands where shaking a bit. My face was probably sad, but nothing exaggerated. I just started working.

I have no idea of what will I do.\n\n[Correction] maybe I have. After publishing this I will send a message saying that I officially quit. It might not do anything for you, but for me it will be something.\n\nI have been answering to every message as soon as I can I am there for everyone, but, as people say, you can't force people to like you. I tried. I did. And maybe for way much longer than I should, but now I quit.\n\nI had been thinking about this for a while now. I for sure need new friends. I don't know if I am going to get them, but I am not gonna be the only one trying to maintain this existing friendship.\n\nYou know. It is usually easy for me to know when I am about to do a bad decision. I know it. Most of the time, and I decide to go through. This time isn't different. \nTo be completely honest I have been thinking about this since day 1 as you can read. 80 days. That is a lot. That is probably too much. Even worse considering the only associated changes are negative.\n\nDon't worry too much. I am not gonna do anything permanent. Yet.

For the memes and other media that was sent on the group? ...maybe...~~to be honest, I was only able to not quit sooner, because I was thinking about the memes. Stupid reason, but...it worked for a while.~~.\n\nOk. It is 23:13. The message on GGU is written simple \"Ok. Eu desisto oficialmente\" ~= \"Ok. I officially quit.\".\n\nI will send it before going to sleep. Now I have time to talk about something more. I still don't know what.\n\nOk. To the individual people of GGU. Don't get the wrong idea. I don't hate no one. I really like every one of you. But, as a group, the effort I have been having into maintaining it doesn't seem to be worth it anymore. From the beginning I said the group was eventually gonna die. And to be honest, I never expected it to last this long. \n\nEverything is meant to die at some point. It is unpredictable the how and when. But it will happen to all of us. (A funny thing to think about if you have way too much free time is just that. What if I where to die right now. Doesn't matter the reason. What would everyone else think? What would they remember? Who would care? Would my life have had a meaning? [Add your own existential crisis in this part as a question here]).\n\nBut. As I said. It is unpredictable. Even something that looks close to death can have a new life. That is also why I didn't leave sooner. And why I will still be in that group for the duration of a week.    \nI refuse to lose my hope. Sometimes it slips away, but now I can't lose it. Not now.\n\nOk. I am not a person to reread what I wrote, so...I hope I didn't make too much mistakes.\n\nRemember. I really like everyone of you, and if someone ever needs to talk, I will always be here. But for now, I need to rest.\n\nSee you all tomorrow. I love y'all.

And to be honest, I never expected it to last this long. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Everything is meant to die at some point. It is unpredictable the how and when. But it will happen to all of us. (A funny thing to think about if you have way too much free time is just that. What if I where to die right now. Doesn&amp;#39;t matter the reason. What would everyone else think? What would they remember? Who would care? Would my life have had a meaning? [Add your own existential crisis in this part as a question here]).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But. As I said. It is unpredictable. Even something that looks close to death can have a new life. That is also why I didn&amp;#39;t leave sooner. And why I will still be in that group for the duration of a week.&lt;br/&gt;\nI refuse to lose my hope. Sometimes it slips away, but now I can&amp;#39;t lose it. Not now.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ok. I am not a person to reread what I wrote, so...I hope I didn&amp;#39;t make too much mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Remember. I really like everyone of you, and if someone ever needs to talk, I will always be here. But for now, I need to rest.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;See you all tomorrow. I love y&amp;#39;all. Good night!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","likes":null,"suggested_sort":"qa","banned_at_utc":null,"view_count":null,"archived":true,"no_follow":false,"is_crosspostable":true,"pinned":false,"over_18":false,"all_awardings":[],"awarders":[],"media_only":false,"can_gild":true,"spoiler":false,"locked":false,"author_flair_text":null,"treatment_tags":[],"visited":false,"removed_by":null,"num_reports":null,"distinguished":null,"subreddit_id":"t5_2s3016","author_is_blocked":false,"mod_reason_by":null,"removal_reason":null,"link_flair_background_color":"","id":"jykyy8","is_robot_indexable":true,"report_reasons":null,"author":"NotMySecretAcount","discussion_type":null,"num_comments":0,"send_replies":true,"whitelist_status":null,"contest_mode":false,"mod_reports":[],"author_patreon_flair":false,"author_flair_text_color":null,"permalink":"/r/u_NotMySecretAcount/comments/jykyy8/82nani_desuggu/","parent_whitelist_status":null,"stickied":false,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/u_NotMySecretAcount/comments/jykyy8/82nani_desuggu/","subreddit_subscribers":0,"created_utc":1606001276,"num_crossposts":0,"media":null,"is_video":false}},{"kind":"t1","data":{"subreddit_id":"t5_2s3016","approved_at_utc":null,"author_is_blocked":false,"comment_type":null,"link_title":"81-I like to talk.

Mainly with Daisy. \nThe conversation reached a point in which I thought about just leaving the group. Instead I just said Bye and turned off wifi. Anything that I might had said in that time would be wrong. Every move was wrong. So I decided to stop. Nothing is forcing me to move anyways. I want to, but that's just it.\n\nAfter that I showered and came back went back online. Said Hi again. And started my math homework. After a couple hours all my work was done and I don't think I fucked up any friendship, so...that is a nice outcome.\n\nI won't have time for all of it today. I will post another one tomorrow in some minutes.\n\nBye.

I think life is the best thing in the world and I am just throwing it away.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I feel a bit sad about this.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I wish I could just tell people how I feel.\nIn theory I could, but other then my online friends, who never meet me IRL, I don&amp;#39;t have the courage to tell any of my in person friends.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Life sucks. I feel like I shouldn&amp;#39;t trust some of my friends. I feel like I should trust some more and others less. But for some reason I don&amp;#39;t. My brain is fucked up. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I should stop talking for today. I am too sleepy. I am not sure what do I want to say. 00:18. I am going to sleep.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Goodbye everyone. Hi hope you feel ok. If you just feel OK, I can listen to your problems. Probably won&amp;#39;t solve anything, but talking helps.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I love you all guys. If you have talked to me for more than a day you are included. Everyone helps.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Good night.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","likes":null,"suggested_sort":"qa","banned_at_utc":null,"view_count":null,"archived":true,"no_follow":false,"is_crosspostable":true,"pinned":false,"over_18":false,"all_awardings":[],"awarders":[],"media_only":false,"can_gild":true,"spoiler":false,"locked":false,"author_flair_text":null,"treatment_tags":[],"visited":false,"removed_by":null,"num_reports":null,"distinguished":null,"subreddit_id":"t5_2s3016","author_is_blocked":false,"mod_reason_by":null,"removal_reason":null,"link_flair_background_color":"","id":"jt6rqs","is_robot_indexable":true,"report_reasons":null,"author":"NotMySecretAcount","discussion_type":null,"num_comments":0,"send_replies":true,"whitelist_status":null,"contest_mode":false,"mod_reports":[],"author_patreon_flair":false,"author_flair_text_color":null,"permalink":"/r/u_NotMySecretAcount/comments/jt6rqs/74sleepy_rambling/","parent_whitelist_status":null,"stickied":false,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/u_NotMySecretAcount/comments/jt6rqs/74sleepy_rambling/","subreddit_subscribers":0,"created_utc":1605226885,"num_crossposts":0,"media":null,"is_video":false}},{"kind":"t3","data":{"approved_at_utc":null,"subreddit":"u_NotMySecretAcount","selftext":"I am still finishing my homework.

Weird...\nBut...even though there was a fucking pandemic, I couldn't be angry at him.\nHe is too good of a friend. And...I needed a hug. A kiss will do, and will actually give me a fun thing to thing about.\n\nThis was around a mouth ago. I remember this day. I was a bit pissed off when I found him.

I am a lonely piece of shit and I couldn't refuse it. At least from him. He is the best.\nI don't think you will ever read this. At least it isn't in the original plan. But, SA, if you are reading this, thanks for being who you are. You are awesome.\n\nOk. The second topic I talked about in 61, is...\nWait.  I WILL REMEMBER IT.\njust a second.......it was about GGU.\n\nOh. I know!\nI was thinking that the first time I went to a friends house(except birtdays) was during a world pandemic.\nThanks Little B for making me feel like a human.\nOh and I should start by saying that this was a long time ago.\nGGU was already a thing, but probably this posts weren't.\nI'm going to check out real quick...(at least 15min have passed) it was still in august...\nWay before this posts.\nIt was summer. And it was weird. I was a bit nervous to be honest. But happy. I was going to see at least two of my friends. That was nice.\nAnd it happened. I saw tree friends and Little B's sister. \nIt was a very nice thing. Weird, for sure. I will say it again. I was genuinely nervous. More than presentations and that type of stuff.\nI didn't really knew what to expect.\n\nBut what I was supposed to talk about, was one of the first things that happened when we reached her house.\nWe hugged. And to be 100% honest that was actually the time I needed it the most. I had already started GGU, and was planning on starting this group. Ad was regularly using this account for it's original purpose.\nI was a bit down. But that hug...It felt like it lasted for an hour, but less than a millisecond, all at the same time. I don't know how to describe it.\nI was avoiding the word magical, but that thing really did a miracle on my mind.\n\nI could spend a week trying to describe it, but I would never find the right words. \nThanks Little B and Daisy.\nTo be honest even doing the simple task of a hug freaked me out a bit. I try not to show it, but I think too much about things that don't mather at all. \n\nThe funny part is that, as few other things in my life(like breaking my harm), I can see this in slow motion.\nI can clearly see the approach with me freaking out internally, the first milliseconds, where I was just worried about everything in the observable universe. And the time after that, in wish my mind was free of all those worrying thoughts. And I clearly remember closing my eyes and getting emotional.\nI can clearly see time slow down in the first two parts and accelerate to top speed in the last. It is a weird feeling, that I had only had a couple times in my life(in important situations).\nAs I said I got emotional, but I'm almost a professional hiding what I feel, when I think I should, and that happy tear WAS NOT MEANT TO COME OUT, so I did it. It didn't stood a chance against my willpower.\n\nFor some reason I think this moment is one I will forever remember.\nIt is a nice memory.\nIt will be good to look back to this in a distant future.\nIf I see this in 5 years, I am obligated to try and unite everyone again.  Doesn't mather how far away everyone is. I need to try.\nJust do it!\n\nOk. I think this is going to end up being one of the longer ones. \nI am not sure even I will be able to read all this after the end of the predicted year.\nThere will be an impossibly large amount of text.\nSome day I have to make a guess.\n\nBut not today.

I am felling a kinda bad. I feel like I have no friends. Lately I've been thinking that I don't want to be. I don't want to stop being. But I don't want to be.\n\nThat might be confusing. Ok. What I'm saying is that I don't want to be. To exist. But I don't want to stop being/existing either. I don't want to be, and I also don't want the action of stopping to be.\nThis made it worse? Idk.\n\nIn my way home I started thinking that I need help.\nI was thinking about school. I might underperform this year, because I'm sad all the time and I don't want to do anything(I have 4 or five pages of math homework [that I actually like] and did nothing other than youtube, reddit and CSGO SDK[the work was sent 4 days ago])\nI was thinking about other thing to. I want more time to go on bike rides. And my mind slowly changed the topic of my mental monologue to \"When can I ride my bike\".\n\nI started thinking that weekends are not an option. Mondays and Thursdays aren't either(online classes).\nSo I came to the conclusion that I wanted it to be tuesday.\nI would go with my mom to school wait 2 minutes, probably put my backpack in my locker and walk home. (*1 from the next paragraph)\nGet my bike, turn off my phone(maybe remove the sim card or try to make a Faraday cage) and just go. \nI would probably wait a couple weeks, until my dad gets back to work, and then I would be able to be alone for a bit of time.\n(*2 from next paragraph) \nI'm not sure where would I go to. Probably I would start by going to a place I like. It is a field with cork oak trees in the middle of an eucalyptus plantation. I find it beautiful. Probably I would pass the road to the \"zona industrial\"(idk how to say it. It is the place for the factories) in the end I would follow the dirt road  under the highway. After that I would probably try to just follow that relative direction (North?) as far as I could. \nAfter that I'm not sure.\n\n1-In this stage I might have a problem. What if I cross my path with someone from my class? What if I cross my path with Daisy? She lives in the path I would follow. And she is usually a bit late, so...it depends on how soon I get to school and how soon I get out of school. That risky part is only 5 to 15 minutes long(depending on the person). Maybe I can just pass through without crossing paths with her. Maybe I'm early and She is late, as usual and I exit the mutual path before she enters it. Idk. \nBut if we were to cross paths and she saw me...\nI can't predict how that would go, but I'm almost sure I would stop my plan. \nI don't think I would lie to her. Probably I would just give vague answers. But I feel like for some reason I would quit my plan no matter what she said. \n\n2-I don't think anyone would notice my absence(except from the teacher)\nI would miss Physics and Portuguese. Both of them would probably play it down, like if I and a medical appointment or something. \nProbably no one from my class would say anything. If someone did, it would be through Whatsapp(class group chat) and it wouldn't even be someone I hang out with. The only option would be for PC or something to make a joke.\nIn the break nothing would happen either. I sometimes see GGU, but not always. It would not be that weird(not that they would care anyway) this ones are the one I think more about. I could just disappear from the face of the world and none of them(my closest friends ever[at least while it lasted]) would know. A week could pass by an no one would know or care. That feeling just makes me sad.\nAnyway. School gives me the whole morning without anyone noticing.\nFrom that point on probably my mom and maybe my dad would call me(at lunch). The best course of action would be not to answer. Sometimes it happens for me to forget my phone on silence, and then not to call back. Not reasons for them to worry.

I am felling a kinda bad. I feel like I have no friends. Lately I&amp;#39;ve been thinking that I don&amp;#39;t want to be. I don&amp;#39;t want to stop being. But I don&amp;#39;t want to be.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That might be confusing. Ok. What I&amp;#39;m saying is that I don&amp;#39;t want to be. To exist. But I don&amp;#39;t want to stop being/existing either. I don&amp;#39;t want to be, and I also don&amp;#39;t want the action of stopping to be.\nThis made it worse? Idk.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In my way home I started thinking that I need help.\nI was thinking about school. I might underperform this year, because I&amp;#39;m sad all the time and I don&amp;#39;t want to do anything(I have 4 or five pages of math homework [that I actually like] and did nothing other than youtube, reddit and CSGO SDK[the work was sent 4 days ago])\nI was thinking about other thing to. I want more time to go on bike rides. And my mind slowly changed the topic of my mental monologue to &amp;quot;When can I ride my bike&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I started thinking that weekends are not an option. Mondays and Thursdays aren&amp;#39;t either(online classes).\nSo I came to the conclusion that I wanted it to be tuesday.\nI would go with my mom to school wait 2 minutes, probably put my backpack in my locker and walk home. (&lt;em&gt;1 from the next paragraph)\nGet my bike, turn off my phone(maybe remove the sim card or try to make a Faraday cage) and just go. \nI would probably wait a couple weeks, until my dad gets back to work, and then I would be able to be alone for a bit of time.\n(&lt;/em&gt;2 from next paragraph) \nI&amp;#39;m not sure where would I go to. Probably I would start by going to a place I like. It is a field with cork oak trees in the middle of an eucalyptus plantation. I find it beautiful. Probably I would pass the road to the &amp;quot;zona industrial&amp;quot;(idk how to say it. It is the place for the factories) in the end I would follow the dirt road  under the highway. After that I would probably try to just follow that relative direction (North?) as far as I could. \nAfter that I&amp;#39;m not sure.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;1-In this stage I might have a problem. What if I cross my path with someone from my class? What if I cross my path with Daisy? She lives in the path I would follow. And she is usually a bit late, so...it depends on how soon I get to school and how soon I get out of school. That risky part is only 5 to 15 minutes long(depending on the person). Maybe I can just pass through without crossing paths with her. Maybe I&amp;#39;m early and She is late, as usual and I exit the mutual path before she enters it. Idk. \nBut if we were to cross paths and she saw me...\nI can&amp;#39;t predict how that would go, but I&amp;#39;m almost sure I would stop my plan. \nI don&amp;#39;t think I would lie to her. Probably I would just give vague answers. But I feel like for some reason I would quit my plan no matter what she said. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;2-I don&amp;#39;t think anyone would notice my absence(except from the teacher)\nI would miss Physics and Portuguese. Both of them would probably play it down, like if I and a medical appointment or something. \nProbably no one from my class would say anything. If someone did, it would be through Whatsapp(class group chat) and it wouldn&amp;#39;t even be someone I hang out with. The only option would be for PC or something to make a joke.\nIn the break nothing would happen either. I sometimes see GGU, but not always. It would not be that weird(not that they would care anyway) this ones are the one I think more about. I could just disappear from the face of the world and none of them(my closest friends ever[at least while it lasted]) would know. A week could pass by an no one would know or care. That feeling just makes me sad.\nAnyway. School gives me the whole morning without anyone noticing.\nFrom that point on probably my mom and maybe my dad would call me(at lunch). The best course of action would be not to answer. Sometimes it happens for me to forget my phone on silence, and then not to call back. Not reasons for them to worry. I don&amp;#39;t want to lie to anyone.\nThat would give me until around 4:30-5:30 pm, to just go away. As far as my legs and my bike tires could get me.\nThat is a 8-9 hours time gap.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the end I would probably just spend the entire day alone. Probably by that time I would call my dad to pick me up wherever I was.

And sent a message on GGU and a message to V after ending. I was ready to get distracted. Not much distraction really came, but Little B need help in the math homework and I had just finished it... of course I helped. I like the thing. It is a bit easy. So...\n\nLittle B did it. She finished the homework. And I went back to youtube, completely forgetting I was talking to V.(sorry)\n\nSome hours of youtube later I remembered her. And sent a \"Hey\".

You can see that I love doing this because in the afternoon I started working on it at 14:55. Some time later I thought that probably it was already time to eat something(around 16:00 to 16:30) looked at my phone and...18:20. I have 10 minutes to pack my things and eat. Well I love doing this type of work.      \n     \n      \nSo... that was the majority of my day. I barely spoke on GGU, because I was focused on that. I even made the light schematics multiple times.    \n      \nAnyway. I awkwardly began a conversation with \"Hello People\". It worked. I was happy. Then. Around 40 minutes later The Salt is typing. And... she says the classes are already on moodle. So... I checked it out. I'm alone again. I've made an huge effort into surpassing this loneliness, and now...it will all be lost.     \n    \nOk. I' not alone. I'm with M404. But I know that he is going to end up changing schools if possible in this year.

But I don't believe that I'm going to maintain contact. And again. I'm sorry for being pessimist. And this might actually be offensive. But I rather be honest. I don't believe I'm going to keep trying for that long. And I don't think you will either.(I have a bit of hope but...) you will have each other. During this time I realized that if I want a conversation, I need to start it. No one is going to do it for me. I might actually talk to people, and they might respond. But only if I give the first step. And I' not strong. I'm a piece of shit with no determination or goals in life. I don't believe I'll keep pushing.      \n     \nI hope this lasts two more weeks. If this lasts until the end of the year I'll celebrate.    \n    \nIDK If I can wait until Daisy's birthday.
