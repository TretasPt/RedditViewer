Someone killed me in the dream.

About two weeks ago I dreamt I was with my dad near a house(in the dream I feel like that is my house, but not my IRL house).

We were there, like 10 meters away on the street when the alarm went off. I got a bit vigilant and saw someone in a dark alway walking away.

I chased that person through a door and 2 steps after, I heard the door close behind me. Looked back to see who had done it and the first guy I was chasing came from behind and slashed my neck with some kind of knife. 

It felt weird. 

All the houses in this dream were very simple and looked like a old source engine map.

Woke up feeling stupid for chasing him alone and getting myself killed.

Anyone knows what happened to r/talk?

Anyone knows what happened to r/talk or can explain what can be the causes for subreddits to be made private?

Oh. And if you know any good alternative please tell me.

Portas e Caminhos.

Ol� pessoas do reddit. J� h� uns anos que ando a procurar uma musica chamada "Portas e Caminhos" de uma banda portuguesa chamada "Polvo".    
    
Lembro-me de ver o videoclipe desta musica (penso que foi no Nickelodeon) h� no m�nimo 7 anos. E na altura consegui encontr�-la no YouTube.

Mas neste momento apenas consigo encontrar referencias a essa musica e pessoas que tamb�m a procuravam.

S� consegui encontrar o [canal de youtube](https://www.youtube.com/user/POLVOGUERRILHA) da banda e alguns sites que todos remetiam para um v�deo indispon�vel no YouTube.

Encontrei tamb�m um site onde vendem o dvd da banda, mas...seria prefer�vel uma vers�o .mp3.
Se algu�m souber alguma coisa, ajuda seria bem vinda.


Edit: J� me ajudaram. Obrigado pela aten��o.

Reddit's logo should be a bit more green.

To symbolize the amount of reused and recycled content.

How long?

I never knew no one who had experienced the same as me.
I'm 16 and I tink this was 7/8 years ago.
How long did it happen to you? Is it still visible?
I'm trying to find out the older ones. Just out of curiosity.

Portal VR idea.

After the release of Half-Life Alix I've been tinking.
Portal VR would be hard to do due to motion sickness.
But I tink that there are ways of doing it.
Below I've written my idea. Please send sugestions.

I'm not a fan of this side storys, but I think they could make one about a man/women physically ill (for some reason that they would explain).
That way they were forced to use portals for locomotion.
GLaDOS would promise you a cure (and if you refused she would even promise cake) to make you do tests.
I think that at the end glados could actualy give you what she promised as an exoskeleton but force you to keep testing.
You would use your new body to try to run away from her (in this part you would use portals and locomotion so the risk of motion sikness will be bigger) and she would just let you go because you would start giving her problems like Shell did.
The story would be smaler. Like if it was a VR introdution, but at the same time I would be happy to know they tryed to give Portal a sequel.

Just a question. How hard is it to make Portal mods?
Any toturial or guide that I should know about?

I need help geting started.[HL1]

I everyone.
I'll start by saying that I'm not fluent in english so I'm sorry for any grammar mistake that I might make while writing this.
I'm trying to make maps for Half-Life 1 and in the begining I folowed some youtube tutorials on how to set up hammer. I'm not sure if it is my fault or not but decals don't work.
I've seen some youtube videos explaining how to do it, but I try it and it does nothing.
I'm going to uninstal hammer but I'm not sure if that does anithing.
Can you explain me what the problem is? Can you send links on how to set hammer up?
And one more thing. Can you tell me what is the best way of lerning this/where to find toturials or guides?
Thanks to anione that reads this. And thank you for the possible suport.

I want to make maps(hl1 and sven co-op) and I want to share the sdk files with a friend. Is there any rule against that?

Why?

Why would you hate reddit.
On reddit you can be wandering around and find someone's account name and tink"i wander what this person has been posting".

Long story short. I found this subreddit.
(If that post was against this subreddits rule do what you want. You are the moderator.)
But completely agre with you on [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/Redditsucksmyballs/comments/e131oe/why_cant_i_see_my_updownvotes_right_away_thats/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share).
